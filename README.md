### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Sara, and I am a student and a beginner to all things programming.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mostly school work assignments
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write code in C++
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on... I don't even know, yet!  
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding my knowledge outside of our classroom.  I'm hoping for more challenging and real-world practice
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my dogs.  They're awesome
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: sarabellus@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I just planted two Paw-Paw trees this year!  And they haven't died yet!  With any luck, I'll have fruit to share in 5 or so years.
